Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,296 out of  50,950    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,905

      to control set restrictions:              90 out of 407,600    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
